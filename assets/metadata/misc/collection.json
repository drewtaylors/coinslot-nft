{"name": "NostaLex", "description": "NostaLex is a collection of 250 1/1 hand-drawn pieces made by artist Coinslot. The body of work is based off Coinslot\u2019s main character Lex the Copy Cat and is inspired by cartoons, movie characters from the early 90s, and memories of watching TV after school.\n\nThe goal of this project is to share the body of work and to reinvest into bigger art projects, the overall Coinslot brand, and give back as much utility such as physical goods, discounts, and events to the Coinslot community.\n\nI invite you to take a journey with me into my childhood and hopefully yours as well. I hope you enjoy this collection as much as I enjoyed creating it.\n\n\\- Coinslot", "image": "ipfs://QmbtCZDTv9mWGv158ThfCW93Mxy8c7MnjDqfjUJeyzBBCF/collection.jpg", "seller_fee_basis_points": 800, "fee_recipient": "0xeCf607e6Ad6Ec6F9B895E818F95Bd3bBdA3152e3"}
